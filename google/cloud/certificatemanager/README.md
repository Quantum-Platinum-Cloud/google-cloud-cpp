# Certificate Manager API C++ Client Library

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for the
[Certificate Manager API][cloud-service-docs], a service to
acquire and manage TLS (SSL) certificates for use with Cloud Load Balancing.

While this library is **GA**, please note that the Google Cloud C++ client
libraries do **not** follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Supported Platforms

- Windows, macOS, Linux
- C++14 (and higher) compilers (we test with GCC >= 7.3, Clang >= 6.0, and
  MSVC >= 2017)
- Environments with or without exceptions
- Bazel (>= 4.0) and CMake (>= 3.5) builds

## Documentation

- Official documentation about the [Certificate Manager API][cloud-service-docs] service
- [Reference doxygen documentation][doxygen-link] for each release of this
  client library
- Detailed header comments in our [public `.h`][source-link] files

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/README.md) directory contains a minimal environment
to get started using this client library in a larger project. The following
"Hello World" program is used in this quickstart, and should give you a taste of
this library.

<!-- inject-quickstart-start -->

```cc
#include "google/cloud/certificatemanager/certificate_manager_client.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) try {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " project-id\n";
    return 1;
  }

  namespace certificatemanager = ::google::cloud::certificatemanager;
  auto client = certificatemanager::CertificateManagerClient(
      certificatemanager::MakeCertificateManagerConnection());

  auto const parent = std::string{"projects/"} + argv[1] + "/locations/-";
  for (auto r : client.ListCertificates(parent)) {
    if (!r) throw std::move(r).status();
    std::cout << r->DebugString() << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
} catch (google::cloud::Status const& status) {
  std::cerr << "google::cloud::Status thrown: " << status << "\n";
  return 1;
} catch (std::exception const& ex) {
  std::cerr << "Standard exception raised: " << ex.what() << "\n";
  return 1;
}
```

- Packaging maintainers or developers who prefer to install the library in a
  fixed directory (such as `/usr/local` or `/opt`) should consult the
  [packaging guide](/doc/packaging.md).

* Developers that prefer using a package manager such as
  [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io), [Conda](https://conda.io),
  or [Conan](https://conan.io) should follow the instructions for their package
  manager.

- Developers wanting to use the libraries as part of a larger CMake or Bazel
  project should consult the [quickstart guides](#quickstart) for the library
  or libraries they want to use.
- Developers wanting to compile the library just to run some examples or
  tests should read the current document.
- Contributors and developers to `google-cloud-cpp` should consult the guide to
  [set up a development workstation][howto-setup-dev-workstation].
